                        <li>The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited to all communal living
                            spaces
                            and bedrooms. Consisting of a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular
                            shapes,
                            Meta’s appearance changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full depending on the
                            viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional storage for your reading material and an even top
                            for

                        <li>Click Shelf</li>
                        <li>Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and construction, as well as the
                            visual lightness, form the aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm thin
                            sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the system functions similar to a construction kit. Only
                            four
                            screws fix the girder together to which the shelves are simply hung up without any tools.
                            The
                            material and precision of the components guarantee the stability and assembly.</li>

                        <li>Float Shelf</li>
                        <li>Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to diverse interpretations –
                            holding a book as a bedside or side table, bearing weight as wall console, storing a
                            magazine
                            collection, serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding small personal essentials as
                            a
                            hallway tray. The Float Shelf equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique
                            accommodation and boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the strict
                            geometry of this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf
                            consists
                            of two offset levels cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition
                            allowing for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic
                            principles
                            of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the essence of a shelf.</li>
